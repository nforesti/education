    "With the continued push for a more educated society, the demand for college degrees in order to obtain a middle-income job has dramatically increased. This need for additional education, after receiving one’s high school diploma, has drastically changed the college enrollment rate. We can see this in the increasing percentage of enrollments from, “35 percent in 2000 to 41 percent in 2016” (NCES).  Due to this increase, the struggle to attend a top-tier university in the United States has only become more difficult due to the rise in college applications per university. As a result, only students whose resumes depict an exceptional, well-versed student, including a plethora of extra-curriculars in addition to top notch grades, make the cut for these top universities and colleges in the United States. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now with the dramatic rise of financial aid, the strive and responsibility for the United States to make all opportunities equal, and the desire for a more diverse college population, our group is curious as to how the racial demographic in both top-tier and bottom colleges compare to the racial demographics of the city in which the university is placed in. In addition, our group wanted to see if any relationship exists between the racial demographics of top universities and the size of the corresponding universities' undergraduation populations."

    "There has been some data to show that college ready, high-school students are continuously applying to schools that are near metropolitan cities because of the desire of excitement expected in a major city. Thus, top-tier educational institutions are conveniently located close to, or are neighboring, major metropolitan cities, such as New York or Boston. In other cases, top ranked institutions are located in what are now coming to be known as “university cities.” These college towns are a new breed of city that stands apart from the usual hustle and bustle of that we are accustomed to seeing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, these cities present with a myriad of interesting attributes. They are a unique urban environment which consists of low crime rates, high population education level, and increased participation within the arts. These are population dense envornments that we would expect to see in major cities, yet they are characteristically closer to a suburban environment. That leads us to the question of racial demographics. With this new breed of city on the rise, we can start to take a closer look at what kind of environment the average college student is living and learning in. A traditional metropolitan city would usually have a large amount of diversity, while a University City would not. This leads to the interest in how the racial gap between the university and city can play into the change of the county based on the racial make-up of the college in that area.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our exploration we looked at the national level for differences between college students and the racial demographic of all people in the United States. When looking at multiple forms of Census data, we can already see the variety in the types of breakdowns of Race and Ethnicity that are the most common. US Census data has a very limited amount of racial and ethnic breakdown. The Census only officially acknowledges Non-Hispanic and Hispanic as ethnicities in their data. There are also a limited number of races that the Census considers in their data. Since the US Census is typically the most accurate dataset in the United States, we will likely be facing issues similar to these when using any dataset involving demographics, unless we use data from a separate source.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also the issue of age range when looking at the publicly available datasets involving personal data. The most obvious issue is that data is generalized into percentages or trends/trend changes. This can be due to a couple of different reasons such as keeping information private. The US Census does allow researchers to access their data after if needed and approved for use in their research, but it is not information that is easily given out. This means that we cannot combine the two variables of race and age and cannot create an accurate portrayal of the differences between the people who are in college and all college-aged people in the United States.\n",

    "Hypothesis for Analysis One: Top ranked universities often attract students from all over the country who vie for admission to these schools. Famous colleges are also under more pressure to admit a diverse range of students in terms of racial demographics. Lower ranked universities tend to have more local students who often pay lower admission fees or are not looking to attend schools outside of their county. Thus, we hypothesize that lower ranked schools will have higher racial demographic similarity with the surrounding county than higher ranked schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis for Analysis Two: Larger unviersities represent a more diverse student body compared to smaller universities. We predict the top tier of undergraduate population are more diverse because bigger universities pull more student applications and therefore are exposed to a more pool of potential students. "

    "For pages 1-37, we sent requests to https://www.niche.com/api/renaissance/results/?type=private&type=public&listURL=best-colleges&page=, which contained information about rankings, names, and links to more information about each of the colleges. For each of these colleges, we then added the unique college link to https://www.niche.com/colleges/. For example, https://www.niche.com/colleges/massachusetts-institute-of-technology/. Lastly, we used Beautiful Soup to extract and print all of the undergraduate population and student racial demographic data to a csv. For the few universities that had missing data, we manually searched the university in Niche.com and entered the demographic data.\n"

    "1. All of the values in this dataframe are strings. Hence, we need to convert the demographic data to numeric values. \n",
    "2. The demographic measurements do not match up with the measurements for the city/county census data. Census data does not have an \"international\" category, so in order to compare college with county data, we dropped the International category. We recognize that many of the international students may actually fall into the other categories (and hence result in underrepresenting numbers for some races), but there is no way to know. This is a limitation of how demographic data is collected for colleges, so we will be cautious."

    "Now that we have a visualization for our data, we can see patterns more clearly and make some inferences. At a glance we can see that the difference in proportion of race between these 3 variables can seem quite significant. Interestingly, it seems as if the Alameda county distribution is closer to UC Berkeley distribution than the City of Berkeley. UC Berkeley shows a very drastic difference with the City of Berkeley in the proportion of African American, Asian, and White people in in those populations. On the other hand, when comparing UC Berkeley with the county of Alameda, the most apparent differences are in the proportion of African American, Asian, Hispanic and Unknown people. Simply from this, we can somewhat predict that a statistically significant may be present in the data."

It seems that both of these values could have a linear relationship, but they each also seem to have one or two outliers. Alameda county does seem to have a less dramatic outlier, so it may have a better fit. These visualizations tell us that there does seem to be a bit of a positive linear relationship between The University and its respective county and city."

On the other hand, Otterbein University, a college ranked at 429 has less diversity, but has demographics very similar to the surrounding county of Delaware, Ohio.\n",

    "## Question: Is there a relationship between the ranking tier (top, middle, bottom) and the similarity between the college and surrounding county demographics?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hypothesis: Top-ranked universities tend to be magnet schools and pull students from all over the nation. Also, in our experience, there is more pressure for top-ranked schools to be racially diverse, whereas counties don't often have racial demographics split equally. Hence, our intuition is that their demographics will not match the counties. Lower-ranked universities often have local students. We hypothesize that lower ranked schools will have higher racial demographic similarity with the surrounding county. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary: To answer this question, we create a \"diversity metric\", a single value for each college or county, to compare. We do this for the top 3 (1-3), middle 3 (429-431), and bottom 3 (878-880) ranked colleges. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations: We recognize that 9 datapoints in 3 different categories (\"top\", \"middle\", and \"bottom\") is not enough to create accurate inferences. However, for each county, we need to manually download data. Hence, due to time constraints, we cannot do this analysis with as much data as we would like. We will be cautious of this while making inferences. "

    "### Data Sources\n",
    "The data involving higher education-specific demographics was posted on Niche for anyone to view. We were required to contact Niche for specific permission to use/analyze their data for academic purposes. Niche found its statistics from various official public sources including the FBI, the U.S. Census, and the Department of Education. The data from Niche provides us the racial demographics of the student bodies of 810 4-year colleges and universities in the United States. Categories include: African American, Asian, Hispanic, International, Multiracial, Native American, Pacific Islander, Unknown, White. Our analysis might not prefer the categories of ‘Multiracial’ and ‘Unknown’ since these categories can add noise to our final result and do not give us insight into any specific race. There is also a concern for the category ‘White’, because this can represent both Europeans and Middle Easterns, which racially are equivalent but are societally seen as separate. Niche’s data does not include the number of students enrolled nor any information about any one student.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also utilize city data from the 2010 U.S. Census, looking at city specific racial demographics for cities with populations over 5,000 people: White, Black/African American, American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, Two or More Races, Hispanic/Latino. The discrepancy between our data sources’ categories are ‘International’ and ‘Unknown’, which are specific to Niche’s data. Since we do not look into anything more specific than percentages within colleges and cities, we do not invade the personal privacy of our subjects. Aside from what has already been mentioned, we do not anticipate any other issues related to privacy and equitable impact due to the public nature of this dataset (people are aware that their demographics are recorded in college admissions as well as on the U.S. Census).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis / Post Analysis\n",
    "The main concern with this data science question is that the results could potentially be used for implementation of racial quotas in universities. If the analysis is not interpreted properly, the results could be used to support policies that move away from merit-based acceptances. \n",
    "In post-analysis, our results show that there is no strong relationship. However, we recognize that we had many limitations in our analysis process, so we have a limited analysis with low ecological validity that should not be applied to real-world policies."

    "In our first analysis, we sought to find out if the racial demographic of universities was statistically different from their surrounding counties. In the start of our analysis we hypothesized that universities would have a lower diversity ranking than the county they are in. Unfortunately, our analysis did not show this trend and therefore we failed to reject the null hypothesis. From the tests we produced, we did manage to find a small trend based on the p-value decreasing from the top level of colleges/cities to middle and bottom level colleges/cities. Thus, there is possibly a correlation between the middle and bottom level colleges as opposed to the top ranking colleges/cities. With our lack of overall correlation, we realize that our results may be due to eliminating categories of data such as “international” students, which could impact our data. \n",
    "\n",
    "For our second analysis regarding whether or not there is a correlation between racial diversity of a university and the size of the university's population, we concluded that there is no statistically significant correlation with the data we worked with. At first, we thought that there would be a slight correlation between the universities that have a larger population and the rank of diversity in their student body. It was our assumption that schools with a larger population receive a larger quantity and therefore larger variety of applications as well. That being said, our analysis did not show this trend or any type of relationship, even when we conducted multiple tests, making us fail to reject the null hypothesis. Though, our research has shown to have no correlation between these two factors, it may be because of confounding variables within our data. For example, our data set included “bi-racial” and “multiracial” categories, which we did not analyze because of the lack of clarity given for each of these sets. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our previously stated limitations likely caused a larger impact than we previously predicted. Simply looking at the US Census, we can see a national trend of changing proportions of ethnicities. We understood that with a more detailed census, we would have been able to calculate a more accurate representation of our racial proportions. It is likely that the particular age range (18-24 years old) in which we were doing our analysis has different proportions than the age range we worked with. In a future attempt, the best way to do a serious analysis of this data would be to limit the age range in the general population of the cities and the counties. This would focus our data and would hopefully produce a clearer picture of racial proportions in these areas."
