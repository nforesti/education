    "With the continued push for a more educated society, the demand for college degrees in order to obtain a middle-income job has dramatically increased. This need for additional education, after receiving one’s high school diploma, has drastically changed the college enrollment rate. We can see this in the increasing percentage of enrollments from, “35 percent in 2000 to 41 percent in 2016” (NCES).  Due to this increase, the struggle to attend a top-tier university in the United States has only become more difficult due to the rise in college applications per university. As a result, only students whose resumes depict an exceptional, well-versed student, including a plethora of extra-curriculars in addition to top notch grades, make the cut for these top universities and colleges in the United States. Now with the dramatic rise of financial aid, the strive and responsibility for the United States to make all opportunities equal, and the desire for a more diverse college population, our group is curious as to how the racial demographic in both top-tier and bottom colleges compare to the racial demographics of the city in which the university is placed in.\n",
    "\n",
    "There has been some data to show that college ready, high-school students are continuously applying to schools that are near metropolitan cities because of the desire of excitement expected in a major city. Thus, top-tier educational institutions are conveniently located close to, or are neighboring, major metropolitan cities, such as New York or Boston. In other cases, top ranked institutions are located in what are now coming to be known as “university cities.” These college towns are a new breed of city that stands apart from the usual hustle and bustle of that we are accustomed to seeing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, these cities present with a myriad of interesting attributes. They are a unique urban environment which consists of low crime rates, high population education level, and increased participation within the arts. These are population dense envornments that we would expect to see in major ciites, yet they are are characteristically closer to a suburban environment. That leads us to the question of racial demographics. With this new breed of city on the rise, we can start to take a closer look at what kind of environment the average college student is living and learning in. An traditional metropolitan city will usually have a large amount of diversity, while a University City would not. This leads to the interest in how the racial gap between the university’s racial demographic and the city surrounding the school can play into the change of the city based on the racial make-up of the college in that area.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our exploration we looked at the national level for differences between college students and the racial demographic of all people in the United States. When looking at multiple forms of census data, we can already see the variety in the types of breakdowns of Race and Ethnicity that are the most common. US Census data has a very limited amount of racial and ethnic breakdown. Then Census only officially acknowledges Non-Hispanic and Hispanic as ethnicities in their data. There are also a limited number of Races that the Census considers in their data. Since the US Census is typically the most accurate dataset in the United States, we will likely be facing issues similar to these when using any dataset involving demographics, unless we use data from a separate source.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also the issue of age range when looking at the publicly available datasets involving personal data. The most obvious issue is that data is generalized into percentages or trends/trend changes. This can be due to a couple of different reasons such as keeping information private. The US Census does allow researchers to access their data after if needed and approved for use in their research, but it is not information that is easily given out. This does mean that there usually are not ways to combine 2 variables since the Census Bureau does not provide this information, and also. This does mean that we would be unable to create an accurate portrayal of the differences between the people who are in college and all college-aged people in the United States.\n",

For each of these colleges, we then added the unique college link to https://www.niche.com/colleges/. For example, https://www.niche.com/colleges/massachusetts-institute-of-technology/. Lastly, we used Beautiful Soup to extract and print all of the undergraduate population and student racial demographic data to a csv. For the few universities that had missing data, we manually searched the university in Niche.com and entered the demographic data.\n"

On the other hand, Otterbein University, a college ranked at 429 has less diversity, but has demographics very similar to the surrounding county of Delaware, Ohio.\n",

    "## Question: Is there a relationship between the ranking tier (top, middle, bottom) and the similarity between the college and surrounding county demographics?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hypothesis: Top-ranked universities tend to be magnet schools and pull students from all over the nation. Also, in our experience, there is more pressure for top-ranked schools to be racially diverse, whereas counties don't often have racial demographics split equally. Hence, our intuition is that their demographics will not match the counties. Lower-ranked universities often have local students. We hypothesize that lower ranked schools will have higher racial demographic similarity with the surrounding county. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary: To answer this question, we create a \"diversity metric\", a single value for each college or county, to compare. We do this for the top 3 (1-3), middle 3 (429-431), and bottom 3 (878-880) ranked colleges. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations: We recognize that 9 datapoints in 3 different categories (\"top\", \"middle\", and \"bottom\") is not enough to create accurate inferences. However, for each county, we need to manually download data. Hence, due to time constraints, we cannot do this analysis with as much data as we would like. We will be cautious of this while making inferences. "

This meant that all of the colleges and counties had the same diversity value, which is clearly not the case, as seen in Graph 1. Hence, we decided to use the variance for each college row as the metric because the value gives more information about dispersion of the racial demographics."

We predict the top tier of undergraduate population are more diverse because bigger universities pull more student applications and therefore are exposed to a more pool of potential students. \n",

We do this for each university and after sorting universities into the top third, middle third, and bottom third based on population, this score helps us determine if there is a trend in our data.\n",

    "The data involving higher education-specific demographics was posted on Niche for anyone to view. We were required to contact Niche for specific permission to use/analyze their data for academic purposes. Niche found its statistics from various official public sources including the FBI, the U.S. Census, and the Department of Education. The data from Niche provides us the racial demographics of the student bodies of 810 4-year colleges and universities in the United States. Categories include: African American, Asian, Hispanic, International, Multiracial, Native American, Pacific Islander, Unknown, White. Our analysis might not prefer the categories of ‘Multiracial’ and ‘Unknown’ since these categories can add noise to our final result and do not give us insight into any specific race. There is also a concern for the category ‘White’, because this can represent both Europeans and Middle Easterns, which racially are equivalent but are societally seen as separate. Niche’s data does not include the number of students enrolled nor any information about any one student.\n",

    "We also utilize city data from the 2010 U.S. Census, looking at city specific racial demographics for cities with populations over 5,000 people: White, Black/African American, American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, Two or More Races, Hispanic/Latino. The discrepancy between our data sources’ categories are ‘International’ and ‘Unknown’, which are specific to Niche’s data. Since we do not look into anything more specific than percentages within colleges and cities, we do not invade the personal privacy of our subjects. Aside from what has already been mentioned, we do not anticipate any other issues related to privacy and equitable impact due to the public nature of this dataset (people are aware that their demographics are recorded in college admissions as well as on the U.S. Census)."
